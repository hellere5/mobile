        <p>I grew up in Cleveland, Ohio and have lived their my whole life. 
          I went to Gilmour Academy for Highschool and played ice hockey and lacrosse.
          During my freetime, I enjoyed hanging out with my friends and cooking. 
          I would always help my mom cook dinner for our family. </p>

        <p>A little secret about me is that I love to travel. My family and I love taking trips together
          to different parts of the world. In this picture, we were in Tel Aviv have appetizers together 
          while looking at the beautiful city. It's the little things in life that make you happy.

        <p>Another thing I love to do is hang out with my friends. In photo, my friends and I were hanging out 
          on the beach and having a picnic. We were able to watch the sunset behind the water and of course were able
          to get good photos. This is something my friends and I love to do when it is nice outside. This photo was also taken
          on the beach in Tel Aviv.

          A fun fact about me is that I used to play ice hockey. I had played since I was 5 years old. 
          My family has actually always been known as a hockey family becuase my entire family played hockey growing up.
          I played hockey all over world: in Prague, Italy, Canada, and Finland.
